Rules:
The Competition Director will act as Commissioner. Draft slots will be chosen at random and we will follow the "snake" drafting method -- participants make their choices in ascending order in odd rounds and descending order in even rounds.
You'll be drafting a "team" of seven ingredients over seven rounds. It's your choice which ingredient you'll draft in each round, but, overall, you must choose:
- 1 malt variety.
- 1 hop variety.
- 1 yeast variety.
- 1 adjunct / spice / fruit.
- 3 "flex" ingredients from any category.
Water, finings, rice hulls, water salts, acids, and yeast nutrients/enzymes are free and do not count as drafted ingredients.
Once an ingredient is drafted, it is taken off the board and cannot be drafted again.
An eighth round -- called the "Oh Sh*t" round -- is optional for you to swap out a single ingredient you drafted for one that is available in the draft pool -- penalty free. After that, it's trades only.

Trading
Trading is encouraged; however, all trades must be approved by the Commissioner. Proposed trades involving the Commissioner will be communicated to all other participants, providing a window of opportunity for objections (with stated grounds, of course).
There is no waiver wire (no drop/add). This means that only drafted ingredients are available for trades.
All trades are 1 for 1. Participants cannot trade two ingredients for a single ingredient, for example.
Each participant is limited to five trades. 
Trade deadline is August 31, 2025.

Submission for Judging
All finished beers are due for judging on November 1, 2025 to be eligible for any payout. The 1st Place winner receives 70% of the buy-in kitty, 2nd Place receives 30%. The winner of the People's Choice vote in the November club meeting will receive a $20 Brew Hut gift card.
Detailed submission directions will be communicated in October.
